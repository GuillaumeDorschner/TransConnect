# TransConnect

TransConnect is a road transportation company that has:

A fleet of vehicles that it uses to deliver various goods
Personnel organized as follows:
TransConnect is looking to expand and needs to hire new employees due to its recent success. As such, it is opening positions for team leaders and drivers.

At any given moment, the company's director, Mr. Dupond, wants to be able to see all of the members of his company along with their hierarchical relationships and profiles. It would also be useful to have a simple, easy-to-understand display of this organizational chart. In addition, as he is more visual, he wants to be able to see the structure of his company whenever there is a departure, layoff, or new hire.

Employees have specific characteristics. An employee is a person who has a social security number, a name, a first name, a date of birth, a postal address, and an email address, as well as a phone number. The name, address, email, and phone number are modifiable. The employee also has a start date at the company, a position, and a salary. The position and salary are also modifiable.

TransConnect also has a database of its clients with the same characteristics as the people described above. (We will simulate these data with a collection of clients in memory). Clients order delivery services for various types and volumes of goods all over France.
